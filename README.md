# brainmappings
It is not on do.Read code but don't do this code for safe.
this project's aim is to map brainlike processing units and to make processing network like AI imitated to human brain.
vision:
 make groups -> make group AA,AB
 make units -> make 10000 units at group AA
 adjust start position and destinations -> make 10000 units to(from group AA state (2.0,5.0,10.1) to group AB state(12.5,10.1,3.0))
 prepare input information -> prepare to unit 10 to unit 500 input sygnal of 0.3
 run network and build solid network
 catch output sygnal and adjust for high performance please give me an opinion if you prefer
